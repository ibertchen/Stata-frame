## Frame

**Frame** is a new feature/function introduced in Stata 16.

- Arguably one of the most significant improvement in Stata updates. 
- Let's talk about the concept of frame... or data frame first. 


## What is Data Frame

. . . 

Data frame is terminology referring to a data object used to containing data. It is one of the fundamental elements in R and Python (with pandas) for a long time. 

. . . 

There are variation of data frame. For example, depending on the packages used in R, data frame is called **_data.frame_**, **_tibble_**, or **_data.table_**. In Stata, it is **_frame(s)_**. 

. . . 

Ideally, a data frame can:

- keep variables, values, and other data properties.
- provide flexible ways to access all or part of stored data.

The main functionality of frame in Stata is to enable a user to **open and process multiple data sets within a single Stata program window**. 


## The limitation

Frame in Stata has limited functionalities, compared to data frame in other tools/programs.
